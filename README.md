# Pressure-Cycling-System
The instrument was developed from scratch for the study of the degradation of the hydriding properties of materials as they are cycled through thousands of successive hydriding / dehydriding processes. A sample reactor with thermal control was developed for this Cycling System, allowing the study of isotherm absorption curves at different temperatures. The fully automated equipment was tested with the intermetallic alloy LaNi5 on 1500 successive hydriding cycles where we clearly observed the degradation as a decrease of the hydrogen maximum capacity and the modifications of the shape of the isotherm curves at different points in the cycling.

The first prototype used a controller via Arduino.
The ultimate control is built with an automated LabVIEW interface
